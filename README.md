Final design is in designs/tetris\_test2

tetris\_test was initial prototype of tetris program on Linux

Tetris AI IP in ip\_repo

Project Name: Hardware Accelerated Tetris AI
    Description: FPGA is used to calculate the optimal next piece placement for
a software tetris running on Microblaze. The purpose was to see if the hardware
accelerated AI will be able to perform as well as software AI.
    How to Use:     1) Download the repository 
2) Open designs/tetris\_test2/tetris\_test2.xpr on Vivado.
            3) Open project Settings and add the ip_repo into the ip repository
            4) Save settings and open block diagram to ensure that none of the
blocks are missing
            5) Synthesize, implement and generate bitstream.
            6) Export to SDK, program and enjoy.
